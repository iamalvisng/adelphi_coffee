// 3rd-party styles, mixins, etc.
// *Interesting findings*
// I wanted to include owl.theme & owl.carousel into the project.
// However it will be complicated to write another return in gulpfile.js
// under sass task just for these tiny plugins
// What I did is to simply include vendors/owl.carousel into the sassPath
// and what I need to do is just including these styesheets by using @import

@import "owl.theme.default.scss";
@import "owl.carousel/owl.carousel";
